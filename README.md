 Wine Data Cleaning - Machine Learning Project
🔗 Repository: [GitHub Link Here]

📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a wine dataset to prepare it for machine learning models. The dataset undergoes various steps like handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and normalization.

🚀 Features
✔️ Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Duplicates, etc.)
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations
✔️ Outlier Detection and Removal
✔️ Feature Engineering and Encoding
✔️ Data Normalization & Scaling
✔️ Ready-to-use Cleaned Dataset

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about different wine samples, including factors like acidity, alcohol content, and quality.

🔽 Download the dataset:

Source: UCI Wine Quality Dataset
Alternative: If included in the repo, you can find it in the /data folder.


💻 Installation
🔧 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Wine-Data-Cleaning.git
cd Wine-Data-Cleaning

📦 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.8). Then, install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually install:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📥 3. Download the Dataset (if not included in repo)
mkdir data
wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv -P data/
wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv -P data/

▶️ How to Run the Project
Using Jupyter Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to wine_data_cleaning.ipynb and run the cells step by step.
Using Python Script
Run the preprocessing script directly:
